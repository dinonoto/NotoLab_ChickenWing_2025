Preparation and Imaging History:

Domestic chicken wing, fixed, was CT scanned at 55 microns (isometric voxels) and 16 bit image depth on a SkyScan 1273. The subsequent scan was downsampled to 8 bit, skipping every other slice, for Github distribution.

The sample was procured fresh from a local grocery vendor, fixed in buffered formalin and stored in 70% ethanol.

Micro-CT scanning was performed by Karly Cohen and took place in the laboratory of Adam Summers at Friday Harbor Laboratories, WA. Parameters included 90 kV, 166 microAmps, and 108 ms exposure. A 1 mm Al filter was used.
